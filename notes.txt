Learn SQL The Hard Way Outline
==============================

Copyright Zed A. Shaw, All Right Reserved.


* Introduction

A book that teaches SQL to anyone, and attempts to bridge people who know OOP
over to understanding ER and SQL.  It uses only SQLite as the "scripting language"
to keep learning simple.  Most exercises will focus on doing things with multiple
tables at the same time, and through indirection teach things like foreign keys.

Each exercise will introduce the concept in the usual "Learn The Hard Way" style.
It will also have a small section on "portability" that explains what might be
different in PostgreSQL and/or MySQL, or any other gotchas to be aware of so that
the book is useful on more than just sqlite3.
