\chapter*{Introduction: Haters Gonna Hate, Or Why You Still Need SQL}

SQL is everywhere, and I'm not saying that because I want you to use it.  It's
just a fact.  I bet you have some in your pocket right now.  All Android Phones
and iPhones have easy access to a SQL database called SQLite and many
applications on your phone use it directly.  It runs banks, hospitals,
universities, governments, small businesses, large ones, just about every
computer and every person on the planet eventually touches something running
SQL.  SQL is an incredibly successful and solid technology.

The problem with SQL is it seems \emph{everyone} hates its guts.  It is a weird
obtuse kind of "non-language" that most programmers can't stand.  It was
designed long before any of these modern problems like "web scale" or Object
Oriented Programming even existed.  Despite being based on a solid
mathematically built theory of operation, it gets enough wrong to be annoying.
Trees? Nested objects and parent child relationships? SQL just laughs in your
face and gives you a massive flat table saying, "You figure it out bro."

Why should you learn SQL if everyone hates it so much?  Because behind this
supposed hate is a lack of understanding of what SQL is and how to use it.
The NoSQL movement is partially a reaction to antiquated database servers,
and also a response to a fear of SQL borne from ignorance of how it works.
By learning SQL, you actually will learn important theoretical concepts that
apply to nearly every data storage system past and present.

No matter what the SQL haters claim, you should learn SQL because it is
everywhere, and it's actually not that hard to learn enough to be educated
about it.  Becoming an educated SQL user will help you make informed
decisions about what databases to use, whether to not use SQL, and give you
a deeper understanding of many of the systems you work with as a programmer.

Ultimately though, I want you to learn SQL because it is very handy.  I can use
SQLite to prototype a simple data model for a web application, or a phone, or a
desktop application in quick order and know it will work just about everywhere
that has SQLite.  This ability to use a cross-platform consistent and powerful
data storage language is worth its weight in gold.

\subsection*{About This Book}

This book teaches SQL to anyone, but it helps you can code already.  The 
concepts in SQL are taught assuming you at least know how to do some programming
even if it's just a tiny bit.  It also assumes you can run commands from the
command line, know how to use the shell, and have access to a good programmer's
text editor.

To keep the book simple, and since managing a giant database server is tangential
to learning SQL, this book will use \href{http://sqlite.org}{SQLite3} to teach
the fundamentals of the language.  It will use SQLite3 similar to how you use
Python or Ruby and you'll be writing full \file{.sql} scripts and running them
to learn the language.  

Each exercise will introduce the concept in the usual "Learn The Hard Way" style.
It will also have a small section on "portability" that explains what might be
different in PostgreSQL and/or MySQL, or any other gotchas to be aware of so that
the book is useful on more than just sqlite3.

When you're done with this book, you should understand SQL well, how to design
data, a bit about optimizing databases, and you should be able to branch out into
another database of your choice.


\subsection*{Against Indoctrination}

You may run into someone who thinks you should learn technology X because 
it is superior.  They'll claim that learning SQLite will cripple you for
life because it is missing features.  Or, they may say SQL is dead and
NoSQL is the future.

The problem with these people is they are trying to indoctrinate you, not
educate you.  They think of the world of technology as a zero sum game
that they have to win, and if you learn SQL or SQLite then you won't
learn their system of choice.  Typically, this indoctrination is designed
so that you must depend on their company's software and services to 
stay alive.

I want to educate you so that you have the ability to make your own choices and
learn anything you want.  I'm only using SQLite because it's the simplest and
most complete SQL system you can install.  Other servers are a huge pain to
install and manage, but SQLite is one download, and it's free, and it's
credible. That's the \emph{only} reason I'm using SQLite.  I don't want you to
be stuck on it.  I don't want to convince you to use SQL over NoSQL.

My only goal is to educate you on this particular tool in the simplest way
I can so that you can improve as a programmer, and do it in such a way that
you do \emph{not} need to depend on me or my services when you're done.

Keep that in mind when people try to tell you that learning SQL will somehow
"cripple" you.  Typically they have something to gain by you remaining
ignorant.

\subsection*{License And Status}

This book is in \emph{ALPHA} status right now.  If you have comments on what it
should and should not teach, then feel free to email help@learncodethehardway.org
and let me know.  Commenting on the contents though is pointless since there
really aren't any.

You are free to read this book, but you can't give it out to anyone else or
host it yourself.  When the book is done I will change the license.
